                    <p>
                        Two years ago, my passion for coding began when I stumbled upon the world of web development. 
                        Starting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I quickly realized that coding was more than just a 
                        skillâ€”it was a creative outlet that allowed me to bring ideas to life.

                    <h3>ðŸ’¡ Building & Learning</h3>
                    <p>
                        As I delved deeper into JavaScript libraries and frameworks like React and Node.js, a world 
                        of possibilities opened up. I've had the opportunity to work on exciting projects including:

                    <ul className="project-highlights">
                        <li>Real-time Messaging Application</li>
                        <li>Interactive Weather Dashboard</li>
                        <li>Fantasy Basketball Voting App</li>
                        <li>PokÃ©mon Encyclopedia (Dexplorer)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These projects involved collaborating with bootcamp teammates, creating wireframes, and 
                        implementing full-stack functionality using the MERN stack and other modern technologies.

                        Every developer faces obstacles, and I'm no different. From debugging complex JavaScript 
                        functions to connecting frontend and backend systems, each challenge has made me more 
                        determined and skilled. I've learned that persistence and problem-solving are just as 
                        important as technical knowledge.
